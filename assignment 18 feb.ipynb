    "API is the acronym for application programming interface — a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. APIs are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.\n",
    "APIs are all around us. Every time we use a rideshare app, send a mobile payment,they connect to the Internet and send data to a server. The server then retrieves that data, interprets it, performs the necessary actions, and sends it back to your phone. The application then interprets that data and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. "

    "Efficiency:\n",
    "When you have content that is automatically published and made available on different channels simultaneously, APIs allow for more efficient data distribution.\n",
    "Adaptability:\n",
